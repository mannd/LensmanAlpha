## Description
This is a preliminary testing ground for development of a starship simulator set in the world of the classic Lensman series by Edward E. Smith, PhD.  This includes the works: inertialess drive, primary and secondary beams, defensive shields, and so on.  The finished program should include:
- "realistic" starship navigation
- predfined startships and custom design
- 3D mapping of star systems with random world generation
- enemy ships and inert and free space battles

After preliminary development, playable versions will be developed on iOS (using Swift), Android (using Java), and possibly the web (using JavaScript).

### Technical issues
- Use earth based galactic coordinates or center of galaxy system (as per series)?  If latter, need to develop conversion formula.
- Graphics.  Lensman technology is not sophisticated computationally and controls probably analogue or CRT based.  CRT screen simulation similar to graphics of 2001 A Space Odyssey (e.g. NAV, COM, etc. screens) might be usable interface.  But no HAL!
- Detailed random world generation.
- Battle simulation.
- Database required for worlds.
    - ? Core Data on iOS
    - ? cloud-based system (users shared data, multiplayer version)
- And a whole lot more!

## Sources
It is not clear if the Lensman copyrights were renewed and if the series is in the pubic domain.  If not, permissions will need to be obtained, or a more generic system (not referencing the books) will need to be developed.
